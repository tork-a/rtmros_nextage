== Introduction ==
This wiki page describes how to create a software module with your own hand device with `Nextage Open`. The robot's Digital In and Output (`DIO`) assignment is available through the Robot Hardware Manual.

== Prerequisite ==
=== Download Source Code ===
In this tutorial, we will add your custom hand module into [[nextage_description]], the original package of NEXTAGE OPEN that stores model information. Even if the package is already installed on your machine via binary installation (eg. by using `apt-get` on Ubuntu), modifying to its protected directory is not a good idea at all and thus you're encouraged to download the source.

{{{
$ cd %YOUR_CATKIN_WORKSPACE%
$ git clone https://github.com/tork-a/rtmros_nextage.git
}}}
 . If you are not familiar with `catkin workspace`, create one by referring to [[http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace|tutorial for creating catkin workspace]].

We will assume we use `nextage_description` package that's in the downloaded source.

=== Prepare Hand Model ===
Let's assume that we have a CAD file we'd like to add new hand called `SuctionHand.wrl,` the file includes a robot model whose coordinate frame is equivalent to original `ChunkHand.wrl`.

{{http://wiki.ros.org/rtmros_nextage?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=Screenshot_from_2013-11-06+10_51_06.png|Sample of NEXTAGE OPEN on Visualizer RViz"|height="260"}} 

In the factory setting of `NEXTAGE OPEN`, the initial pose of the arms is like the image above where the upper arm links straight down, links from elbows to hands stretching toward the front of the robot. The absolute coordinate of the robot: x axis points forward from the robot chest, the y axis is to the robot's left, and the z axis is in the vertical up direction. The origin of the hand model is located on the interface flange surface.

Put the `.wrl` file under `nextage_description/models`

== Convert To Semantic Model for RTM-ROS world ==
=== Add your model to OpenHRP3 wrl model file ===
(TODO: elaborate why we need to do this, what's OpenHRP3 wrl model, etc.)

Change [[https://github.com/tork-a/rtmros_nextage/blob/groovy-devel/nextage_description/models/main.wrl|nextage_description/models/main.wrl]] as follows:

{{{
 # 'Inline {url "ChunkHand.wrl"}'
 'Inline {url "SuctionHand.wrl"}"
}}}
The portion that contains the same line of code now looks like this:

{{{
 Transform {
  translation  -0.065 0 0 children [
   # Inline { url "ChuckHand.wrl" }
   Inline { url "SuctionHand.wrl" }
  ]
 }
}}}

=== Create COLLADA model ===
(TODO: elaborate why we need to do this, what's dae model, etc.)

Run following commands to convert `wrl` model into `COLLADA` format:

{{{
 $ roscd nextage_description/models
 $ rosrun openhrp3 export-collada -i main.wrl -o main.dae
 $ cp main.dae ../../nextage_ros_bridge/nextage.dae
}}}
=== Create URDF model ===
(TODO: elaborate why we need to do this, where to get collada_tools, etc.)

Run following commands to convert COLLADA model into URDF model:

{{{
 $ cd ../urdf
 $ rosrun collada_tools collada_to_urdf ../models/main.dae --mesh_output_dir=meshes --mesh_prefix=package://nextage_description/urdf/meshes
 $ sed s/HiroNX/NextageOpen/ HiroNX.urdf  > NextageOpen.urdf  # --(*) )--
}}}
(*) if you want to avoid this, you have to change DEF HiroNX Humanoid to DEF NextageOpen Humanoid in main.wrl, this may have several side-effects, for example we have to change  `args.robot = "RobotHardware0"` if `args.host` else "HiroNX(Robot)0" to NextageOpen(Robot)0 in nextage.py

==== Tips ====
Better to check urdf file with :

{{{
$ roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=urdf/Nextage.urdf gui:=True
}}}
(This does not work with collada file since `joint_state_publisher` does not read collada file)

If you use .deb binary package, you have to run with sudo, or create new [[nextage_description]] package under user land.

== Create MoveIt! package containing hands ==
(TBD) : We do not think anything is needed for using MoveIt with new hands model

== Create Software In Python ==
You're almost ready to get your hands moving. Now, coding time.

Hand's software implementation of Nextage employs [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern|Command Pattern]]. With this design, task to add a custom hand software module can be minimized; create `Command` class where the hands' specific functionalities are defined, and bind it to another class that represents hands, and finally use it from "main" robot client module (eg. [[https://github.com/tork-a/rtmros_nextage/blob/groovy-devel/nextage_ros_bridge/src/nextage_ros_bridge/nextage_client.py|nextage_client.py]]).

{{attachment:classDiag_nextage_hands_handcommand.png|Nextage hand class hierchy|height="325"}} ([[https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1sloogpB9dv4VbcouHKH6hZynTmZ9-tvdxSzDJ27KRcE/edit|Original diagram file]])

=== Add Hand's Function By Creating "Command" Class ===
First, create a python file that extends [[https://github.com/tork-a/rtmros_nextage/blob/groovy-devel/nextage_ros_bridge/src/nextage_ros_bridge/command/abs_hand_command.py|nextage_ros_bridge/abs_hand_command.py]] that contains basic stuff for all hand modules, put it in the source folder of [[nextage_ros_bridge]].

{{{
$ roscd nextage_ros_bridge/src/nextage_ros_bridge/command
$ touch %YOUR_COMMAND%.py
}}}
Then from here, we'll look at a code snippet of a concrete example of [[https://github.com/tork-a/rtmros_nextage/blob/ba7fd582add4b3563f2f5fb8af7720b358d52ce9/nextage_ros_bridge/src/nextage_ros_bridge/command/airhand_command.py|suction hand python module]] (cited Feb 2, 2014):

    Following Command design pattern, this class represents command for
    an Airhand of NEXTAGE OPEN.

    testing environment for left arm).

        else:
            # TODO: Might want to thrown exception?
            rospy.logwarn('No gripper specified. Do nothing.')
            return

    def _assign_dio_names(self):

        self._DIO_SUCTION_L_1 = self._DIO_27
        self._DIO_SUCTION_L_2 = self._DIO_28
}}}
Now let's look at what this `airhand_command.py` does step-by-step:

    <<CodeRef(airhand_command_py,11,11)>>
    Extending `AbsractHandCommand` as already mentioned.
    
    <<CodeRef(airhand_command_py,22,24)>> Possible commands are defined as member variables. With the design of this particular class, this command represents multiple functionalities that this hand provides (which, may be a little confusing with respect to the concept of `Command` Pattern). Related to that, it's more useful to keep these accessible to the external classes (ie. no leading underscore with their names).
    
    <<CodeRef(airhand_command_py,30,38)>> Initializing with just passing arguments to the constructor of its super class.
    
    <<CodeRef(airhand_command_py,75,83)>> We skip and reach down the bottom of the code first where we re-assign the name of `DIO`s to adjust to the specific purpose the `DIO`s are used for this class. To do so by overriding method `_assign_dio_names` isn't mandatory (though recommended to avoid confusion of other developers or even you in the future).
    
    In this particular class, these four `DIO`s are used for the stated purposes, which are defined in the hand's electrical design (TODO: reference to electrical design tutorial how to assign DIO if any)).
    
    Now going back up the code,
    
    <<CodeRef(airhand_command_py,41,41)>> This part is the "body" of the functions your custom hand provides.
    
    <<CodeRef(airhand_command_py,45,46)>> Here you prepare two lists: `dout` and `mask`. While writing this hand's code, you're freed from bit manipulation although the interface of the robot's `DIO` is designed to interact by bit arrays. You just have to specify which the specific bits to use.
    
    So the two lists are:
    
     * `dout`: bit values that indicate on/off of the DIO pins.
     * `mask`: Represents the enabled pin(s).
    
    <<CodeRef(airhand_command_py,49,51)>> Now the operations are coded. Here we're only looking at the first conditional block; the rest is just in similar structure.
    
    Simply we assign the bit for the identified side of the hands for the designated operation (`draw in` in this case).

    <<CodeRef(airhand_command_py,73,73)>> This line is `required`; we send out the bit arrays to the DIO interface.

=== Bind Hand-command to Hand Class ===
We've added a hand, a model and its function. So now we're good to use it.

First, instantiate the command class you just created in a Hand class. You can look at [[https://github.com/tork-a/rtmros_nextage/blob/b19a6e2246fb818e69e9239485dcb42db6e92025/nextage_ros_bridge/src/nextage_ros_bridge/iros13_hands.py#L69|a sample here]], some of which is cited like:

{{{
class Iros13Hands(BaseToolchangerHands):
:
    def __init__(self, parent):
        '''
        @see: AbsractIros13Hands.__init__
        '''
        self.airhand_l_command = AirhandCommand(self, self.HAND_L)
        self.airhand_r_command = AirhandCommand(self, self.HAND_R)
}}}
Add the side as an argument. That's it for the `Hand` class.

Very finally, you are all ready to use the hand!

=== Use Hand-command From Robot Client ===
From robot's client class, like NextageClient, you can call `execute` function of each `Command` class ([[https://github.com/tork-a/rtmros_nextage/blob/b19a6e2246fb818e69e9239485dcb42db6e92025/nextage_ros_bridge/src/nextage_ros_bridge/nextage_client.py#L95|just like these methods in NextageClient class]]).

That's it! As I predicted, hand-command is pretty much all the code you need to write in order to add your custom hand module.
